# Bayesian Marginal Treatment Effects

## Description
This directory includes both an R package that researchers can use to implement the model described in the paper "From LATE to ATE: A Bayesian Approach" by Isaac M. Opper -- in the "bayesianMTE'" folder -- as well as the code used to replicate the results in the paper -- in the "Replicating Opper (2023)" folder. For more information on the method, see the paper.

## Authors and acknowledgment
I am very thankful to Aarya Suryavanshi, who took the lead in developing the R package, and to Joshua Eagan who helped QA the code. I'm also thankful to Stephanie Rennane and Jessie Cox, who both provided valuable feedback on an early draft, as well as Lisa Jaycox for all her help, support, and patience during my particularly challenging -- and not particularly on-time -- RIR. Finally, the comments I initially received from two anonymous referees, the AE, and editor truly transformed the paper and I am grateful for their careful read and thoughtful comments. Funding for this research was provided by gifts from RAND supporters and income from operations.
